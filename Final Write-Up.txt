For the final milestone we deviated a bit from our updated proposal in that we decided not to add a treasure system and did not manage to improve the AI any further. We did however add a new ability for the player where they can now fire a missile with a mouse click. We managed to add some more advanced physics into the game and implemented some of the advanced features required by the milestone.
